* Session 1
 * Pre-calss [interview and quiz] (misc/pre-class-quiz.docx)
 * Trainer's notes: [Overview of data journalism](notes/session-1-notes.pdf)
 * The infographic on harassment in Egypt: data is available in this [Report in English](http://harassmap.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/287_Summaryreport_eng_low-1.pdf). Notice how they collected data!
* Session 2 
 * Trainer's notes: [Data Sources] (notes/DataSources.pdf)
 * West Bank hotels data: there seems to be an error in the occupancy ratio. See [this Excel file](misc/WestBank-Hotels.xlsx) which has two sheets (data re-ordered and chart added in sheet2). Original data from [PCBS] (http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_Rainbow/Documents/T.S-%20Tourism-%20An-A-2015.htm) (direct link). Try also to correlate the chart on sheet2 with data and chart from [WorldBank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/DT.ODA.ALLD.CD?locations=PS)  
 * Anonymous quiz: [review of session 1 and brain storming for session 2](misc/ddj-after-session1.docx) 
 * The Palestinian [right to information draft law](notes/right-to-info-law-draft.doc)
* Session 3
 * You are expected to start thinking about your final project (preferably in groups of 3 with possible exceptions). Prepare some ideas/topics and have an abstract ready by next session 
 * We have made available [air quality data](https://github.com/abedkhooli/ds1/tree/master/data) from sensors in the Ramallah area. You can use it both for training and as part of your project.
 * Trainer's notes: [Data Search and Acquisition](notes/DataSearchAndAcquisition.pdf)
* Session 4
 * The excel files for crimes: [crimes in Palestine.xlsx](misc/crimes in Palestine.xlsx), [crimes2.xlsx](misc/crime2.xlsx). Here's a modified [file with governorate populations](misc/crime3.xlsx) which shows an interesting fact. Note: in the original file, ratios are, most likely, based on 2010 or 2011 population in West Bank (which is a problem). Here's a link to [PCBS population](http://pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_Rainbow/Documents/gover.htm).
  * Trainer's notes: [data to stories](notes/data2stories.pdf)
* Session 5
 * Is this true? [Duck's Quacks Don't Echo](misc/ducks-echo.png) and a [horse dies if you cut its tail](misc/horse-tail.png)
 * Trainer's notes: [verification](notes/verification-slides.pdf)
